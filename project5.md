Project 5 - Choose your own adventure
========================================================

### Proposal Due - Friday April 27, 5PM
### Checkpoint 1 Due - Tuesday May 8, start of class
### Code and *Demonstration* Due - Wednesday May 16, 5PM

For this project, you will propose and implement either an extension to Project 4 or a new project related to something we have discussed during the semester. 

**Requirements Overview:** Your final grade will be based upon (1) your proposal, (2) your progress demonstrated by checkpoint 1, (3) the functionality of your final submission, (4) the design of your final submission, (5) the degree of difficulty of your proposed project, and (6) your final demonstration. Submissions that demonstrate a low level of difficulty and/or few new features will be graded accordingly. Upon reading your proposal I will give you feedback on the level of difficulty of the project.

**Proposal:** By April 27 at 5pm, you will submit a two-paragraph description of your project. This will be submitted as a README.md file in your project-5 github repository. I will review and provide feedback.

**Suggestions:** Following are some ideas for Project 5. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, and is meant to inspire your creativity. Keep in mind that I will expect the amount of work required for Project 5 to exceed that of Project 4. Some of these ideas may be good starting points, but may require a more thorough project to be completed for full credit.

- Implement an alternate strategy for your replicated back-end data store (e.g., eventual consistency if you previously implemented strong) and perform a performance evaluation to compare the new strategy to the strategy used for Project 4.
- Explore installing, configuring, and integrating existing tools (e.g., Cassandra, MySQL with different replication strategies, etc) into your ticket purchase application. Perform some performance evaluation.
- Implement Raft.
- Implement distributed transactions with object-based locks, including logging.
- Implement an alternate election algorithm and compare it to the bully algorithm.
- Add new functionality to your ticket purchase application. To earn full credit for this option you will need to add *several* new features. Some examples include user authentication, deletion of events and/or user accounts, and searching.
- Extend Project 2 to support a BitTorrent-like approach for downloading history. This will require you to do some research on BitTorrent.

You may, with permission of the instructor, propose a project not on this list.

### Requirements

1. **Proposal: Due Friday 4/27 - 5pm - 15%**
  * Use the following link to create your private github repository for this assignment: [Project 5]()
  * Commit to your repository a two-paragraph (at least) description of your proposed project. Be as specific as possible, outlining milestones and deliverables.

2. **Checkpoint 1:* Due Tuesday 5/8 - start of class - 15%**
  * During class, you will demonstrate your progress. This checkpoint is worth 15% of the final grade of the project, so you will earn no better than 85% if you have not started your project by this checkpoint.

3. **Demonstration: Due Wednesday 5/16 - 5pm - 30%**
  * During finals week you will schedule a 30-minute demonstration of your final project. Demo slots will be filled on a first-come first-served basis, so only about half of you will be able to demo on the last day. Please plan accordingly.

4. **Code: Due Wednesday 5/16 - 5pm - 40%**
  *By the final deadline, all code must be submitted to your github repository.

For full credit, make sure to follow all [Style Guidelines](https://github.com/CS682-S18/notes/blob/master/style.md). Points will be deducted for each violation.

### Academic Dishonesty

Any work you submit is expected to be your own original work. If you use any web resources in developing your code you are strongly advised to cite those resources. The only exception to this rule is code that is posted on the class website. The URL of the resource you used in a comment in your code is fine. If I google even a single line of uncited code and find it on the internet you may get a 0 on the assignment or an F in the class. You may also get a 0 on the assignment or an F in the class if your solution is at all similar to that of any other student.
